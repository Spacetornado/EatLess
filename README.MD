# EatLess

A simple Valheim mod that adds versions of vanilla cooked foods that last 2 hours. The recipes cost 3x the ingredients. Every "Hi-Cal" food is cooked at the cauldron. Otherwise the foods are the same as the original. Designed for peopele who get tired of eating every 10 minutes.

Developed December 2022. Compatible with Mistlands Update.
